# CIP Core (Generic Profile) Demonstration and Test Images

This generates bootable images for virtual and physical targets using the
Debian package set of the [CIP](https://www.cip-project.org/) Core Generic
Profile and the CIP SLTS kernel.

The build system used for this is [Isar](https://github.com/ilbers/isar), an
image generator that assembles Debian binaries or builds individual packages
from scratch.

## Building Target Images

Install `kas-docker` from the [kas project](https://github.com/siemens/kas):

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siemens/kas/master/kas-docker
    chmod a+x kas-docker

Furthermore, install docker and make sure you have required permissions to
start containers.

To build, e.g., the QEMU AMD64 target inside Docker, invoke kas-docker like
this:

    ./kas-docker --isar build kas-cip.yml:kas/board/qemu-amd64.yml

This image can be run using `start-qemu.sh x86`.

The BeagleBone Black target is selected by `... kas-cip.yml:kas/board/bbb.yml`. In
order to build the image with the PREEMPT-RT kernel, append `:kas/opt/rt.yml` to
the above. Append `:kas/opt/4.4.yml` to use the kernel version 4.4 instead of 4.19.

Physical targets will generate ready-to-boot images under
`build/tmp/deploy/images/`. To flash, e.g., the BeagleBone Black image to an SD
card, run

    dd if=build/tmp/deploy/images/bbb/cip-core-image-cip-core-buster-bbb.wic.img \
       of=/dev/<medium-device> bs=1M status=progress

## Building Security target images
Building images for QEMU x86-64bit machine

    ./kas-docker --isar build --target cip-core-image-security kas.yml:board-qemu-amd64.yml

Run the generated securiy images on QEMU (x86-64bit)

    TARGET_IMAGE=cip-core-image-security ./start-qemu.sh amd64
